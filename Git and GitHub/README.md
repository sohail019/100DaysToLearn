# Git and GitHub

## Day 1 - 02/09/2023
Welcome to Day 1 of my 100 Days to Learn Front-End Development Challenge! 🚀

## Overview
Today, I dived into the world of Git and GitHub, essential tools for version control and collaborative development in web development projects. Below, you'll find a summary of what I learned and the key concepts covered:

## What I Learned

- **Git Basics**: I started by understanding the fundamental concepts of version control, the importance of tracking changes, and why Git is crucial in software development.

- **Git Commands**: Explored basic Git commands like `git init`, `git add`, `git commit`, and `git status` to create and manage Git repositories.

- **GitHub**: Learned how to create a GitHub account, set up SSH keys, and create a new repository.

- **Collaboration**: Explored the basics of collaborative development on GitHub, including forking repositories and making pull requests.

## Next Steps

For Day 2, I plan to dive deeper into Git and GitHub, covering topics like branching, merging, and more advanced Git workflows. Stay tuned for more updates on my journey! 🌟
