        Once a roadmap is built, it needs to be shared with the entire product
        team so everyone understands the vision and direction. In many
        organizations, product owners create their roadmaps in
        <span style="background-color: yellow; color: purple">
          PowerPoint and spreadsheets, and then email the slides and
          spreadsheets out to the team.
        </span>
        <br />
        While well-intentioned, this strategy is flawed from the start. Each
        team member has their own copy of the roadmap, and keeping everyone up
        to speed when and if the roadmap changes is cumbersome (to say the
        least).
